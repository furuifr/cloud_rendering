### Giraffe is a Distributed Monte Carlo Path Tracer which has its own path tracing language, written in C++11/14

### It has become an offline rendering library [Zebra](https://github.com/UncP/Zebra)

#### If you are interested in Giraffe
`Enter src directory and make && ./Giraffe puppy 4`  
`puppy is in directory scene, all file in scene is Ok`  
`4 means sample number, default is 1, you can change it to 8, 16...`  
`Also you need to have header file png.h and compiler that supports C++11/14, if not, change parameter 14 to 11 in Makefile`
